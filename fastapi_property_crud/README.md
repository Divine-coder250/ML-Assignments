My fastAPI project is called fastapi_property_crud. I used mySQL. And you will need to run it in an environment where fastapi is installed globally. And you will also need to install these packages:Sqlalchemy, pyndatic.

After you have all that you can run it using: uvicorn main:app --reload

This folder also contains dataFrame assignment which is in data_collection folder where you'll find its own readme file.
