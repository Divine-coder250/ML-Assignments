This is the readme file of dataframe assignment. I used mySQL database. You have to first run generate_data1.py and generate_data2.py to generate data for both tables and the generated data will be saved in dataset1.csv and dataset2.csv respectively. But just in case you don't want to generate data again, dataset1.csv and dataset2.csv already contain some generated data over 500,000 rows. After that you'll run import_data1.py and import_data2.py to import data in both tables of mySQL database. After that you'll run exploratory_data_analysis.py which contains the main assignment.


You'll need the following packages:
faker,psycopg2,pandas,sklearn,numpy


The process in commands:
>python generate_data1.py
>python generate_data2.py
>python import_data1.py
>python import_data2.py
>python exploratory_data_analysis.py
